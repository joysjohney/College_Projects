<p>"With reference to the evacuation of Overseas China from Libya which has experienced deterioration in its security situation, the Consulate General has the honour to further express its sincere thanks to ACS for its great efforts in order to achieve this task.
<br  /><br  />
ACS has offered 5 chartered flights, which enabled us to succeed in evacuating nearly 800 Chinese from both Sabha Libya and Khartoum Sudan.
<br  /><br  />
The Consulate General points out its great appreciation to the Director of ACS – Dubai, who has paid great efforts, offered flexible charter flight services according to our urgent demand and changeable situation, and proposed practical advices, without which the realization of our goal would be even more difficult."

<p>"We have had occasion to use Air Charter Service at very short notice and were extremely impressed with the level of service they provided.
<br  /><br  />
The charter we arranged was done outside of the normal working day and with only a few hours notice.
<br  /><br  />
The team at Air Charter Service responded with an exceptionally prompt and professional service - nothing was too much trouble and their care and attention to detail was second to none.
<br  /><br  />
I would have no hesitation in recommending them to anybody considering chartering an aircraft and, indeed, would certainly use them again in the future."

<p>"You were a pleasure to deal with in the planning stages, and totally efficient in your approach, sending me photos of the planes and explaining  all the different options.
<br  /><br  />
Despite chops and changes you kept a positive attitude and I felt you were always on the end of the phone  if I had any queries.
<br  /><br  />
I was particularly impressed with the attention to detail in making sure that the guests were looked after, and any unforeseen contingencies dealt with promptly.
